/* Service worker for the "Flextext Recorder" PWA. Precaches its own thin shell PLUS
 * the shared engine it loads from the Flextext Editor repo (same origin), so the
 * recorder works fully offline.
 *
 * VERSION COUPLING — IMPORTANT: this SW caches byte copies of the editor engine
 * (/flextext-editor/js/*.js, css/app.css). Those files have their own lifecycle
 * in the editor repo. Bump VERSION here whenever you deploy — AND specifically
 * whenever the editor engine changes in a way the recorder should pick up — or
 * installed recorders keep serving a stale cached engine offline.
 *
 * ⚠ ENGINE below is the editor ENGINE_VERSION this satellite was built against, and
 * test/version-sync.test.mjs FAILS unless it matches the editor exactly. That is the guard
 * for the failure bumping VERSION alone cannot prevent: if this file is not edited at all,
 * the publish workflow finds the mirror unchanged, reports "no change — nothing to
 * publish", exits 0, and installed copies go on serving a STALE engine. The ordering gate
 * cannot see that — it only checks that the editor is live and its paths are 200, which
 * they are. Editing ENGINE is also what makes these bytes change, which is what makes the
 * browser fetch and install this worker at all. */
